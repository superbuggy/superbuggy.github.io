    I am an experienced computer programmer with 7 years of web development experience,
    who started programming for fun at the age of 8. I have a passion for learning tricky
    concepts and expressing them with lucid simplicity. I thrive on collaboration and the
    collective synthesis of ideas. My interests in education, computer science, language,
    and music composition revolve around complex systems that facilitate creative
    collaboration.

  <p>
    Working with others to distill ideas, talents, and passions into creative solutions is
    vital for me as a person and a worker. I am looking for a role as a senior or lead
    developer on a team with a strong spirit of creative collaboration and excellence in
    engineering.
